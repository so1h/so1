SO1 is a small operating system for the 8086 architecture.
It is written in C using the Borland C 5.2 compiler, the
TASM32 and JWASM assemblers, and TLINK and JWLINK binders.
This toolchain can be used perfectly on Windows in
32-bit and 64-bit versions (in the case of TLINK thanks 
to the use of the Takeda Toshiya's MSDOS Player).

SO1 is simply intended to be a tool for teaching operating 
systems in the early stages of study of the mattery. The 
compilation (on Windows) and the running on Windows (NTVDM) 
or on virtual machines (qemu, bochs, DOSBox, ...) as on a 
real machine (a standard PC) natively using a USB pen drive, 
are tasks that require few minutes, to through a short 
sequence of simple steps, which makes SO1 an ideal way to 
start the student in knowledge of the internal functioning 
of a operating system.
